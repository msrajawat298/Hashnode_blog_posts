Hi folks,

I want to share something with you. If you’re watching a YouTube tutorial and you feel it’s really useful but forget to like or comment on the video, you’re not alone. I get it—sometimes I forget too. Often, it’s because I’ve opened multiple tabs for the same topic, switching between videos to find the best one. I might spend a lot of time on the first video, get the information I need, and then skip the rest without engaging. Sound familiar?

Here’s what I want to share: if you watch a video for more than two minutes and find it helpful, take a moment to read the comments. Trust me, the comments section can be incredibly insightful. Even if you don’t want to like or comment on the video yourself, reading others’ perspectives can give you a new point of view.

For example, I recently watched this video:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEF4UaM5m4U?si=mtcE7aB4TaIsiOrm"></iframe>

I really appreciate the creator because he provides excellent tutorials, dives deep into topics, and clearly explains problem statements along with their solutions. In that particular video, he introduced a new feature in JavaScript. While watching, I was thinking about how people nowadays use frameworks like Next.js and React.js, and I was inspired to try implementing those features myself.

Then, I checked the comments. Some people were saying the feature isn’t good or useful, while others shared their opinions and experiences. It was a great way to understand different perspectives and learn more about how others approach the topic. Reading the comments helped me see the feature from multiple angles, which was really valuable.

So, next time you watch a helpful video, don’t skip the comments! You might discover insights you hadn’t considered before.
